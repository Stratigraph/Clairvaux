## Synopsis

This project aims to predict and visualize armed conflict data for African states. 
Realtime data is pulled from [ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project)] (http://www.acleddata.com) on regular intervals.
Prediction module uses Numenta's [Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)] (http://numenta.org/) model, which is based on a brain-inspired theory of neuroscience.

## Motivation

The primary motivation is to learn about Numenta's HTM framework. 
A secondary motivation is to explore techniques for categorical prediction and predictive visualization.
